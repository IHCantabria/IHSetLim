## Summary

Bernabeu et al. (2003) proposed a two-section equilibrium beach profile model (2S-EBP) based on the concept of the previous studies. This model is useful for predicting the equilibrium beach profile under various conditions.

## Model formula

Bernabeu et al. (2003) proposed the 2S-EBP to predict static beach profile for two separated sections (i.e., surf and shoaling profiles) as follows:

```text
Surf profile:
x = (h/A)^(3/2) + B/A^(3/2)h^3   for   0 ≤ x ≤ x_r
Shoaling profile:
X = x - x_0 = (h/C)^(3/2) + D/C^(3/2)h^3   for   x_r ≤ x ≤ x_a

h : the water depth from mean sea level
x : the cross-shore distance from the shoreline
A,B,C,D : the calibration parameters that depend on the energy dissipation and the reflection process
x_0 : the cross-shore distance between the beginning of the surf profile and the virtual origin of the shoaling profile over the mean sea level
```
